I am currently a PhD candicate of Peking University, interested in Data Science. 
I am familiar with R language and Python, and good at using these languages to do data analysis and visualization. And I am now applying graduate program in USA. 
I used to work in a laboratory doing research with biomaterials.  However, I wanted to work on problems that had a more immediate impact on the world, and tied in my analytical, communicational and coding abilities.  So I did not hesitate to make this change and deeply I believe I will achieve something great.

Some of the technologies I'm familar with:

* R
* Python
* SQL
* Matlab
* Java
* SPSS
* Tableau
* MS Office Suite
