This is a project of the [Data Science Working Group](http://www.datascience-working.org) (DSWG) for the [Bayes Impact Hackathon](http://bayeshack.org).  The DSWG worked with the US Department of Transportation to develop a model to predict hazardous material incidents in a 24-hour period.  Within the Hackathon we were finalists and continue to refine the project, working with the DOT.
