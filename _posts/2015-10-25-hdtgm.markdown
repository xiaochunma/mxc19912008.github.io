Charts exploring actor/director/writer connections between movies.  The chart shows actors/directors/writers who appear in more than one movie, with some mouseover effects to highlight individuals.  The color of their circle represents the number of movies they have appeared in.

I use a bash script to query two movie APIs, then use Node to run a script that parses the response into the JSON file for drawing the chart.
