I used to work in a laboratory doing research with lasers and materials.  I wanted to work on topics that had a more immediate impact on the world, and tied in my aesthetics and communication abilities.  I'm interested in data visualization that enables better decision making, and working on projects that have a day-to-day impact on users.

Some of the technologies I'm familar with:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* D3.js
* jQuery
* AngularJS
* Bootstrap
* Ruby on Rails
* Laravel
* mySQL
* PHP
* Vagrant
* Swagger/OpenAPI
* git/GitHub
* qGIS
* OpenLayers, Leaflet, MapBox
* topoJSON/geoJSON
