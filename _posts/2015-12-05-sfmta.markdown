A way to visualize the SFMTA Bus System according to service frequency by each hour of the day.

Choose an hour and click on "Draw Route".  The MTA bus routes are drawn based on projected service for the hour following what was chosen.

For the live implementation, the service numbers were computed for each hour in a Ruby-on-Rails app and saved in json format.
