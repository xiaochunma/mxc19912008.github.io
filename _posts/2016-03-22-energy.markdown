This is a project of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) within the Code for San Francisco Brigade. We are working with the SF Department of Environment to visualize some of their data in a custom dashboard, and to create solutions to their data-related needs.

See the dashboard [here](http://smoningi.github.io/SF-Environment-Benchmark/dashboard/), and check out the original map interface [here](http://smoningi.github.io/SF-Environment-Benchmark/map/)
