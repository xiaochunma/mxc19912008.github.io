A map showing how each precinct in SF voted in the 2016 primary election.  While looking through the [election returns data](http://www.sfelections.org/results/20160607/#english_detail) I wondered what it would look like on a map, so I made this.  

[SF Curbed](http://sf.curbed.com/2016/7/1/12085274/voter-map-san-francisco) wrote a blurb, and I even got a mention in the [SF Chronicle](http://www.sfchronicle.com/entertainment/garchik/article/How-San-Francisco-voted-in-the-primary-by-the-8348705.php)!
