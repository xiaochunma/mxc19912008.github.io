This SFBrigade project started with me being the only developer, making a quick Rails app, but has since attracted several more.

CycleReady highlights the popular biking routes in San Francisco, allowing new cyclists the change to explore the city with some peace of mind.

Some interesting features I figured out include elevation profiles and distance information for routes and determining what neighborhoods each route passes through.
